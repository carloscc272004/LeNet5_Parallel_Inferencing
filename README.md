# Lenet5_Parallel_Interfacing

## Objective 

The objective of this project is to gain practical experience in hardware-based AI programming 
by deploying and optimizing the LeNet convolutional neural network on two different platforms: 
the NVIDIA Jetson Nano using CUDA for GPU acceleration, and the MSP430FR5994 
microcontroller using quantization and onboard hardware accelerators. We aim to explore how 
AI models perform in both high-performance and resource-constrained environments. The goal 
is to understand how different hardware setups affect speed, accuracy, and memory usage when 
running the same model. By testing LeNet on both systems, we were able to compare execution 
times, model sizes, and overall efficiency. This also helped us learn how to adjust AI models 
depending on the device they're running on and gave us a better idea of whatâ€™s required to make 
AI work on embedded systems.
